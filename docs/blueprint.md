# **App Name**: Evangeline's Welcome

## Core Features:

- Welcome Message: Display a welcome message with the baby's name (Evangeline), date, time, and location.
- Countdown Timer: Implement a countdown timer showing the remaining time until the baby shower.
- Map Integration: Integrate a Google Maps embed for the event location (Club Tayrona).
- RSVP Button: Provide a button linking to a Google Forms RSVP form for guests to confirm their attendance.
- Themed Animations: Add animated baby shower-themed decorations such as clouds, balloons, and confetti. Animate the image of the baby/parents in the center of a nice ring, too. Provide animations for any other elements that contribute to user engagement.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background gradient using: #ffffff, #768b81, #bfd8b3, #99a186
- Accents: #b39a4d for the baby shower title, baby's name (Evangeline) and RSVP button. 
- Use 'List Script' for headings, the welcome message, baby name etc.
- Mobile-first responsive design to ensure the layout looks good on mobile devices. Ensure the date, time and place info appear on one line each, even on mobile. The countdown timer should not wrap on mobile, it should always appear as one row.
- Use subtle animations throughout the page. Implement subtle animations for the countdown timer, decorative elements (clouds and confetti). Use fade in effects, moving backgrounds and image zooming on rollover to make things look interesting.
